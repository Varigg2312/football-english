    "intro_hook": "Master the art of timing and teamwork to catch attackers offside and turn defence into attack.",
    "core_concept": {
      "explanation": "The offside trap is a coordinated defensive strategy where defenders step forward in unison just before an opponent's pass is played, aiming to leave an attacking player in an offside position. It requires perfect timing, communication, and a high defensive line. When executed correctly, it stops an attack and awards your team a free-kick.",
      "analogy": "It's like a perfectly timed jump in a game of jump rope. The defenders are the rope-turners, deciding the exact moment to 'swing' the rope (the defensive line) up, catching the attacker (the jumper) who mistimed their entry."

    "vocabulary_rich": [
      {
        "term": "Offside Line",
        "meaning": "The imaginary line across the pitch, level with the second-last defender (usually the last outfield player)."
      },
      {
        "term": "High Line",
        "meaning": "A defensive strategy where the back line positions themselves far up the pitch, close to the halfway line, to compress space."
      },
      {
        "term": "Stepping Up",
        "meaning": "The synchronized movement of the defensive line forward to catch an opponent offside."
      },
      {
        "term": "Playing the Trap",
        "meaning": "The act of deliberately luring an opponent into an offside position by holding a high line and timing the step forward."
