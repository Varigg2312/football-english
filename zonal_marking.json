    "intro_hook": "Don't chase shadows, control the ground they run on.",
    "core_concept": {
      "explanation": "Zonal marking is a defensive strategy where players are responsible for a specific zone or area of the pitch, rather than tracking a specific opponent. The primary objective is to protect dangerous spaces, force attackers into less threatening areas, and maintain the team's defensive shape. It relies on communication, spatial awareness, and collective responsibility.",
      "analogy": "Think of it like a goalkeeper organizing a wall for a free-kick. Each player in the wall is responsible for blocking the ball from entering their specific section of the goal, not for marking the player taking the kick. They hold their zone."

      {
        "term": "Zone",

        "term": "Defensive Shape",
        "meaning": "The organized structure and formation of a team when not in possession of the ball."

        "term": "Space-Oriented",
        "meaning": "A tactical focus on controlling and denying areas of the pitch rather than directly engaging opponents."
      },
      {
        "term": "Cover Shadow",
        "meaning": "The area of the pitch that a defender blocks access to simply by their body position and presence, without making a tackle."

            "outcome": "CORRECT",
            "feedback": "Correct. In zonal marking, you defend the space. You trust teammates in adjacent zones to pick up runners, and you focus on clearing the ball from your area."

            "outcome": "WRONG",
