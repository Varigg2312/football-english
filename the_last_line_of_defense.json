      "explanation": "In English, the present perfect tense (have/has + past participle) is used to describe actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past or have relevance to the present. It emphasizes the result or experience rather than when it occurred.",
      "analogy": "Just as a goalkeeper's save prevents a goal and affects the current score, the present perfect connects past actions to the present situation, showing their ongoing impact."

    "scenario_text": "You are the goalkeeper in a crucial match. Your team is leading 1-0 in the 85th minute. The opposing striker breaks through your defense and shoots from close range, but you make a spectacular diving save to parry the ball away. Your coach shouts from the sideline, 'Great save! How many times have you saved us this season?'",
