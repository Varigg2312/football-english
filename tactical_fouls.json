    "intro_hook": "Sometimes, a foul isn't a mistake\u2014it's a calculated decision to stop a dangerous attack.",
    "core_concept": {
      "explanation": "A tactical foul is a deliberate infringement committed to stop an opponent's promising attack, usually by a defender who is out of position. While it results in a free-kick and often a yellow card, it is considered a worthwhile trade-off to prevent a more dangerous scoring opportunity.",
      "analogy": "It's like a defender in basketball intentionally fouling a player on a fast break to prevent an easy layup, accepting the free throws to reset the defence."

    "vocabulary_rich": [
      {
        "term": "Professional Foul",
        "meaning": "A deliberate foul, usually a trip or pull, committed to stop a promising attack."

        "term": "Taking One for the Team",
        "meaning": "A phrase describing a player who commits a tactical foul and accepts the resulting booking."

      {
        "term": "Last Man",
        "meaning": "The final defender between the attacker and the goalkeeper; a foul by this player often results in a red card."

      {
        "term": "Stopping a Counter-Attack",
        "meaning": "The primary purpose of a tactical foul\u2014to halt a fast break by the opposition before it develops."

            "outcome": "CORRECT",
