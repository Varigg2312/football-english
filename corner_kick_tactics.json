    "intro_hook": "Don't just cross it and hope. A well-drilled corner is a golden chance to score.",
    "core_concept": {
      "explanation": "Corner kicks are planned attacking plays from the corner flag. Teams use specific routines to create scoring opportunities, involving player movement, blocking defenders, and precise delivery. The aim is to outsmart the organised defence.",
      "analogy": "Think of it like a rehearsed play in basketball or American football. Everyone has a specific role and timing to create space for the key scorer."

      {
        "term": "Near Post",
        "meaning": "The goalpost closest to where the corner is being taken. A common target for flick-ons."
      },
      {
        "term": "Far Post",
        "meaning": "The goalpost furthest from the corner taker. Often targeted for deeper crosses."
      },
      {
        "term": "Delivery",
        "meaning": "The act of kicking the ball from the corner flag. Can be in-swinging (curving towards goal) or out-swinging (curving away)."
      },
      {
        "term": "Block/Run",
        "meaning": "An attacking player's movement to impede a defender, creating space for a teammate to attack the ball."

            "outcome": "CORRECT",
