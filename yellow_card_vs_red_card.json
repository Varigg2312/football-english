      "explanation": "In English football, 'yellow card' and 'red card' are specific terms for disciplinary actions. A 'yellow card' is a formal warning for a serious foul or unsporting behaviour. A 'red card' is a dismissal from the game, usually for a very dangerous foul, violent conduct, or receiving a second yellow card. The key grammar is using the articles 'a' or 'the' with these terms (e.g., 'He got a yellow card', 'The red card was deserved').",
      "analogy": "Think of it like a traffic light system. A yellow card is a 'caution' light \u2013 slow down and be careful. A red card is a 'stop' light \u2013 your game is over."

        "outcome": "WRONG",
        "feedback": "While it's a serious foul, a professional foul that denies a clear goal-scoring opportunity is usually a red card. However, if the tackle was reckless but not excessively forceful, a yellow card might be given. The scenario says it's a 'late, sliding tackle from behind', which is often a straight red."
      },
      {
        "text": "The referee shows a yellow card.",
        "outcome": "CORRECT",
        "feedback": "Good thinking! This is a classic 'professional foul' to stop an attack. While it can be a red, it is very commonly punished with a yellow card, especially if the referee judges the tackle as reckless rather than using excessive force. The key language point: 'He was shown a yellow card for the foul.'"
      },
      {
        "text": "The referee gives a verbal warning but no card.",
        "outcome": "WRONG",
        "feedback": "This type of foul, which stops a promising attack, is almost always punished with at least a yellow card. A simple warning would be very unusual and incorrect according to the Laws of the Game."
