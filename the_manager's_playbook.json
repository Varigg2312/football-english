    "core_concept": {
      "explanation": "In English, the term 'manager' refers to a person responsible for controlling or administering an organization or group. In football, the manager oversees team strategy, player selection, and match tactics. Grammatically, 'manager' is a countable noun (e.g., 'a manager', 'the managers') and can be used with verbs like 'appoint', 'sack', or 'support'.",
      "analogy": "Just as a football manager devises formations and substitutions to win games, a language learner uses grammar rules and vocabulary to construct winning sentences."

    "vocabulary_rich": [
      {
        "term": "Manager",
        "meaning": "The person in charge of a football team, responsible for tactics, training, and player management."
      },
      {
        "term": "Tactics",
        "meaning": "The specific plans or strategies used by a manager to achieve success in a match."
      },
      {
        "term": "Formation",
        "meaning": "The arrangement of players on the field, chosen by the manager to optimize team performance."
      },
      {
        "term": "Substitution",
        "meaning": "The act of replacing one player with another during a match, often a strategic decision by the manager."
      },
      {
        "term": "Touchline",

      {
        "text": "We needs to change our formation to 4-4-2 for more attack.",
        "outcome": "WRONG",
        "feedback": "Incorrect: 'We needs' should be 'We need' because 'we' requires the base form 'need'. Also, 'for more attack' is awkward; use 'for more attacking play'."
      },
      {
        "text": "I am making a substitution to bring on a striker for a defender.",
        "outcome": "CORRECT",
        "feedback": "Correct: This uses proper subject-verb agreement ('I am making'), clear vocabulary ('substitution', 'striker', 'defender'), and a logical football strategy."
      },
      {
        "text": "Manager say we should press high up the pitch.",
        "outcome": "WRONG",
        "feedback": "Incorrect: 'Manager say' should be 'The manager says' or 'I say' for proper article use and verb conjugation. Also, it lacks clarity in who is speaking."
      },
      {
        "text": "Let's switch to a defensive mindset and hold the lead.",
        "outcome": "WRONG",
        "feedback": "Incorrect: While grammatically sound, this is contextually wrong because the team is losing, not leading. It misapplies the football scenario."
