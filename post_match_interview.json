      "explanation": "A post-match interview is a conversation where a player or manager answers questions from journalists immediately after a game. It's a chance to explain performance, give credit, and show sportsmanship. The language used is often diplomatic, positive, and focused on the team.",
      "analogy": "Think of it like the team's post-game debrief, but for the public. You analyse the key moments, praise your teammates' work rate, and set your sights on the next fixture, just as you would in the dressing room."
