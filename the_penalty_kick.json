    "core_concept": {
      "explanation": "In English, 'penalty' refers to a punishment or consequence for breaking a rule. In grammar, it can be used metaphorically to describe errors in language that lead to misunderstandings, similar to how a foul in football results in a penalty kick. For example, using the wrong tense might 'penalize' your communication by confusing the timeline of events.",
      "analogy": "Just as a defender's foul in the box gives the opponent a penalty kick, a grammatical mistake in your sentence can give your listener a 'free shot' at misunderstanding you. Both require precision and calm under pressure to avoid negative outcomes."

    "vocabulary_rich": [
      {
        "term": "Penalty",
        "meaning": "A punishment imposed for breaking a rule, often used in sports like football for fouls in the penalty area."
      },
      {
        "term": "Foul",
        "meaning": "An unfair or illegal action in sports, which can lead to penalties such as free kicks or penalty kicks."
      },
      {
        "term": "Spot-kick",
        "meaning": "Another term for a penalty kick, taken from a marked spot 12 yards from the goal."
      },
      {
        "term": "Goalkeeper",
        "meaning": "The player who defends the goal, especially during penalty kicks, trying to save the shot."
      },
      {
        "term": "Retake",
        "meaning": "To take a penalty kick again, usually due to an infringement like the goalkeeper moving off the line early."

    "scenario_text": "You're watching a tense football match where the score is 1-1 in the 90th minute. A defender commits a foul inside the penalty area, and the referee awards a penalty kick. The striker steps up to take it, but the goalkeeper is known for saving penalties. As the striker prepares, you think about how to describe this high-pressure moment in English.",
    "options": [
      {
        "text": "Use the phrase 'It's a easy goal' to describe the penalty.",
        "outcome": "WRONG",
        "feedback": "This is incorrect because 'easy' should be 'an easy' due to the vowel sound at the start of 'easy'. Also, penalties are often not easy due to the pressure and goalkeeper's skill, so it might not accurately reflect the scenario."
      },
      {
        "text": "Say 'The striker must stay calm under pressure to convert the penalty.'",
        "outcome": "CORRECT",
        "feedback": "This is correct because it uses proper grammar ('must stay' for obligation) and vocabulary ('convert the penalty' means to score from it), effectively capturing the tense situation."
      },
      {
        "text": "Describe it as 'He kick the ball into the net.'",
        "outcome": "WRONG",
        "feedback": "This is incorrect due to grammatical error: 'kick' should be 'kicks' for third-person singular present tense, or use past tense 'kicked' if describing a completed action. It also lacks detail about the penalty context."
